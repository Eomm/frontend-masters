# Notes

Basically, Reactjs transforms your application state into DOM nodes.

## Different state types

- Model data state: the nouns in your application
- View/UI state: are those nouns sorted in ascending or descending?
- Session state: is the user logged in or not?
- Communication state: are we fetching the nouns from the server?
- Location state: what page are we on?

All these states can be grouped into two categories:

- Model state: data in your application
- Ephemeral state: everything else that will be wiped out when you hit refresh
